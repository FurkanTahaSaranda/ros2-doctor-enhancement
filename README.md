# ros2-doctor-enhancement
This project focuses on enhancing the diagnostic capabilities of the ros2 doctor command-line tool. It aims to improve the detection and reporting of configuration issues in the ROS 2 environment, including middleware status, environment variables, and system health checks.

This script captures the diagnostic output of the ros2 doctor command and saves it to a local file. It simulates the core idea of extending ROS 2 CLI for better debugging, one of the key deliverables in my GSoC 2025 project.
